        <p>A high school student from China Mainland.</p>
        <p>Not a programmer currently.</p>

    <h2 style="margin-top: 1.5em">Interests and works</h2>
    <p>
      Someone adviced me to write something about my works. However, I just don't have anything to show off. As a
      student, I don't have much time to spend on computing. So, no works.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides computing, I'm really into
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm_game">rhythm games</a>. I'm an active player of the community-driven
      rhythm game <a href="https://cytoid.io/">Cytoid</a> and I has contributed some levels to it. Also, I've written
      some <a href="https://github.com/CytoidCommunity/Schemas">JSON Schemas</a> for Cytoid.
    </p>
    <p>But, it's not a <strong>real</strong> project, isn't it?</p>
    <p>
      I'm also a co-leader of <a href="https://github.com/phi-x">PhiX</a>, which is a fanmade project of
      <a href="https://zh.moegirl.org.cn/Phigros">Phigros</a>. But, as the main developer
      <a href="https://github.com/AsakuraMizu">water_lift (a.k.a. AsakuraMizu)</a>
      is going through a hard time, this project become temporarily abandoned.
    </p>
    <p>
      In real world, I'm leading the computer club in my school. But unfortunately due to some unavoidable restrictions,
      we haven't done any public works.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also have a <a href="https://space.bilibili.com/172844097">Bilibili</a> channel, but it is not frequently
      updated.
    </p>

    <h2>About this website</h2>
    <p>
      This website is built using pure HTML and CSS. I also used
      <a href="https://picturepan2.github.io/spectre/">Spectre</a> CSS framework to build it. I didn't write any code,
      so there is no license.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you really want to see its source code, please see the
      <a href="https://github.com/ZeroAurora/zeroaurora.github.io">repository</a>. Or just hit <kbd>F12</kbd> (or
      <kbd>Ctrl-Shift-I</kbd> if you prefer).
    </p>
    <p>
      This HTML file is badly formatted using <a href="https://prettier.io/">Prettier</a>. It's great for code but not
      for hand-written HTML. I should really use a static website generator. Maybe sometime later?
    </p>
    <p>
      One last thing: I have built my homepage for about 3 times and this should be my forth homepage. It's made on the
      last day of 2020!
      <!-- Happy new year to myself! -->
